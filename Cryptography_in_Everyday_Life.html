                        Authentication and digital signatures are a very important application of public-key
                        cryptography. For example, if you receive a message from me that I have encrypted with my
                        private key and you are able to decrypt it using my public key, you should feel reasonably
                        certain that the message did in fact come from me. If I think it necessary to keep the message
                        secret, I may encrypt the message with my private key and then with your public key, that way
                        only you can read the message, and you will know that the message came from me. The only
                        requirement is that public keys are associated with their users by a trusted manner, for example
                        a trusted directory. To address this weakness, the standards community has invented an object
                        called a certificate. A certificate contains, the certificate issuer's name, the name of the
                        subject for whom the certificate is being issued, the public key of the subject, and some time
                        stamps. You know the public key is good, because the certificate issuer has a certificate
                        too.<br><br>

                        Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a software package originally developed by Phil Zimmerman that
                        provides encryption and authentication for e-mail and file storage applications. Zimmerman
                        developed his freeware program using existing encryption techniques, and made it available on
                        multiple platforms. It provides message encryption, digital signatures, data compression, and
                        e-mail compatibility. PGP uses RSA for key transport and IDEA for bulk encryption of messages.
                        Zimmerman ran into legal problems with RSA over his use of the RSA algorithm in his program. PGP
                        is now available in a couple of legal forms: MIT PGP versions 2.6 and later are legal freeware
                        for non-commercial use, and Viacrypt PGP versions 2.7 and later are legal commercial versions of
                        the same software.

                    Electronic Money</h3>

                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                        The definition of electronic money (also called electronic cash or digital cash) is a term that
                        is still evolving. It includes transactions carried out electronically with a net transfer of
                        funds from one party to another, which may be either debit or credit and can be either anonymous
                        or identified. There are both hardware and software implementations.<br>

                        Anonymous applications do not reveal the identity of the customer and are based on blind
                        signature schemes. (Digicash's Ecash) Identified spending schemes reveal the identity of the
                        customer and are based on more general forms of signature schemes. Anonymous schemes are the
                        electronic analog of cash, while identified schemes are the electronic analog of a debit or
                        credit card. There are also some hybrid approaches where payments can be anonymous with respect
                        to the merchant but not the bank (CyberCash credit card transactions) ; or anonymous to
                        everyone, but traceable (a sequence of purchases can be related, but not linked directly to the
                        spender's identity).<br>

                        Encryption is used in electronic money schemes to protect conventional transaction data like
                        account numbers and transaction amounts, digital signatures can replace handwritten signatures
                        or a credit-card authorizations, and public-key encryption can provide confidentiality. There
                        are several systems that cover this range of applications, from transactions mimicking
                        conventional paper transactions with values of several dollars and up, to various micropayment
                        schemes that batch extremely low cost transactions into amounts that will bear the overhead of
                        encryption and clearing the bank. <br>

                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                        Netscape has developed a public-key protocol called Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for providing data
                        security layered between TCP/IP (the foundation of Internet-based communications) and
                        application
                        protocols (such as HTTP, Telnet, NNTP, or FTP). SSL supports data encryption, server
                        authentication,
                        message integrity, and client authentication for TCP/IP connections.<br>

                        The SSL Handshake Protocol authenticates each end of the connection (server and client), with
                        the second or client authentication being optional. In phase 1, the client requests the server's
                        certificate and its cipher preferences. When the client receives this information, it generates
                        a master key and encrypts it with the server's public key, then sends the encrypted master key to
                        the server. The server decrypts the master key with its private key, then authenticates itself to
                        the client by returning a message encrypted with the master key. Following data is encrypted with
                        keys derived from the master key. Phase 2, client authentication, is optional. The server challenges
                        the client, and the client responds by returning the client's digital signature on the challenge
                        with its public-key certificate.<br>

                        SSL uses the RSA public-key cryptosystem for the authentication steps. After the exchange of
                        keys, a number of different cryptosystems are used, including RC2, RC4, IDEA, DES and triple-DES. <br><br>
