                        Control (or lack of) after a web page has been decrypted is an interesting aspect of web page
                        encryption that differentiates it from rights management. Classical cryptography is utterly
                        brilliant at creating secrets. It is used by government and the banks to ensure that information
                        remains secret from those who are not entitled to see it. The thing is that encryption does not
                        control how information is used after it is decrypted. What it does do is protect it from being
                        used at all by anyone who is not authorized.<br>

                        So web page encryption may suit some purposes, but may not be suitable in all instances. Whilst
                        banks may have staff who can be trusted (although if we read the security reviews the major
                        threat is the people inside rather than the people outside) it is not always clear that all the
                        recipients of web page encryption can be ‘trusted’ to obey the rules that the web page provider
                        wishes to have followed.<br>

                        Web page encryption allows a publisher to ensure that only the people who have been authorized
                        are able to make use of the information that is protected. And that can be extremely important.
                        Web page encryption is one of the most important security techniques available and least used
                        today for the protection of information. Although it has the potential to be able to allow
                        companies to make ‘publicly’ available information that only the approved people can see nobody
                        actually uses that kind of service.<br>

                        Web page encryption allows absolute control over who is able to receive and use information on a
                        web page. It must NOT be confused with SSL, which does not control anything at all, except the
                        transfer of information. It does not prove where information came from, or who it is for. It is
                        no real security at all compared to real web page encryption, and is a most unfortunate service
                        because it has been misrepresented by some sections of the IT security industry as providing
                        security when it is delivering a mere illusion to both the sender and the recipient.<br>

                        There are plenty of warnings delivered by security experts about ‘security by obscurity’. Well,
                        SSL is the ultimate in delivering a con. You should not blame the people who developed the
                        standard. They made it utterly clear what their standard did and did not do. But do feel free to
                        blame industry PR hype that has claimed that SSL provides a security that it does not, and has
                        glossed over what it does not do. If it was real security we would not have identity theft of
                        credit card transactions. But the fact of the matter is that as soon as SSL protected
                        information arrives at a web site it is available for anyone to see (especially the hacker) and
                        is stored on the web server in the unprotected form in which it arrives. In fact, it is actually
                        impossible for the web site owner to use the SSL protection to continue to protect the content
                        they receive. So web page encryption requires significantly more than SSL.<br>

                        And even if you are using web page encryption, you can be absolutely certain that your
                        information is not being protected at all if you are not using digital rights management
                        controls in addition to web page encryption because you have no way of ensuring, even if you are
                        using web page encryption, that your rules for the use of the information you are protecting
                        must actually be followed.<br>
