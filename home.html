                        Cryptography, or cryptology (from Ancient Greek: κρυπτός, romanized: kryptós "hidden, secret"),
                        is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third
                        parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing
                        protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various
                        aspects in
                        information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and
                        non-repudiation
                        are central to modern cryptography.
                        Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer
                        science,electrical engineering, communication science, and physics. Applications of cryptography
                        include
                        electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, and
                        military
                        communications.

                        The main classical cipher types are transposition ciphers, which rearrange the order of
                        letters in a
                        message (e.g., 'hello world' becomes 'ehlol owrdl' in a trivially simple rearrangement
                        scheme), and
                        substitution ciphers, which systematically replace letters or groups of letters with other
                        letters
                        or groups of letters (e.g., 'fly at once' becomes 'gmz bu podf' by replacing each letter
                        with the
                        one following it in the Latin alphabet). Simple versions of either have never offered much
                        confidentiality from enterprising opponents. An early substitution cipher was the Caesar
                        cipher, in
                        which each letter in the plaintext was replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions
                        further
                        down the alphabet. Suetonius reports that Julius Caesar used it with a shift of three to
                        communicate
                        with his generals. Atbash is an example of an early Hebrew cipher. The earliest known use of
                        cryptography is some carved ciphertext on stone in Egypt (ca 1900 BCE), but this may have
                        been done
                        for the amusement of literate observers rather than as a way of concealing information.

                        The Greeks of Classical times are said to have known of ciphers (e.g., the scytale
                        transposition
                        cipher claimed to have been used by the Spartan military). Steganography (i.e., hiding
                        even the
                        existence of a message so as to keep it confidential) was also first developed in ancient
                        times. An
                        early example, from Herodotus, was a message tattooed on a slave's shaved head and concealed
                        under
                        the regrown hair. More modern examples of steganography include the use of invisible
                        ink,
                        microdots, and digital watermarks to conceal information. The Gree<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">ks of Classical times 
                         are said to have known of ciphers (e.g., the scytale

                            the existence of a message so as to keep it confidential) was also first developed in
                            ancient
                            times. An early example, from Herodotus, was a message tattooed on a slave's shaved head and
                            concealed under the regrown hair.More modern examples of steganography include the use

                            invisible ink, microdots, and digital watermarks to conceal information.

                            In India, the 2000-year-old Kamasutra of Vātsyāyana speaks of two different kinds of ciphers
                            called Kautiliyam and Mulavediya. In the Kautiliyam, the cipher letter substitutions are
                            based
                            on phonetic relations, such as vowels becoming consonants. In the Mulavediya, the cipher
                            alphabet consists of pairing letters and using the reciprocal ones.
